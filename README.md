<h1>Project weatherify</h1>

<br>

<h3>This is a multi-responsive weather application that makes use of Open Weather API</h3>

<br>

<h3>This project has multiple components and css variables and can be used as a study point or practice demo for a standard weather application</h3>

<br>

<h4><b>All components and code are licensed for re-use except the Open Weather API key which is my personal key</b></h4>
